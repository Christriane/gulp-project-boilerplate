# Gulp Project Boilerplate

A simple gulp boilerplate setup that includes live reload, image compression, code minification and scss support. I built this while following 
a couple of YouTube and Medium tutorials so there is probably some redundancy and novice mistakes. Feel free to pull and update.

```
> git clone https://github.com/Christriane/gulp-project-boilerplate.git

```
