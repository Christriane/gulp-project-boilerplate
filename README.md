# Gulp Project Boilerplate

A simple gulp boilerplate setup that includes live reload, image compression, code minification and scss support. I built this while following 
a couple of YouTube and Medium tutorials so there is probably some redundancy and novice mistakes. Feel free to pull and update.

## To Run Project
```
> git clone 
> yarn
> gulp watch
> Enjoy
```

## To Create Build files
```
> gulp build
```
The build files will be placed inside the dist folder.
